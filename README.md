# Designer-folders

# some words about it

This is a simple automation program that only exists to help a friend be more efficient at creating folders for a new project.
Right now it is really basic, but in the future i might improve it.


# How to use
It is a really easy to use program as it only asks 1 to 2 questions and nothing else.

1) On the first prompt, input the path to a folder in which you want to create the files and the files are created and stored there.

2) In the case that the path doesn't exists a prompt will show asking if you want to create it, if the answer is "si"(yes), the folder is created and the files are stored there.
